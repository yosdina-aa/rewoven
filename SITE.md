# Your site

This is the team's website. It's a [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start)
app (React + Vite + Tailwind), served on **port 3000**. It starts life as a simple
"coming soon" placeholder (the headline reads the business name from `site.json` at
request time), but it's a real full-stack framework — build it out into the real
site and grow it into a dynamic app without changing hosting or starting a second
server.

## Layout

```
src/
  routes/
    __root.tsx     # the HTML shell: <head>, fonts, global layout
    index.tsx      # the landing page ("/")
  styles/app.css   # Tailwind entrypoint + base styles
vite.config.ts     # serves on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

Add a page by creating a new file under `src/routes/` — e.g. `about.tsx` becomes
`/about`. Files are routes; the router is generated automatically.

## Serving and shipping

How this site is served and how changes go live **depends on the team's setup**:
your system prompt's **Website** section is the authority — follow it, not this
file. The `package.json` scripts (`publish`, `go-live`) exist for setups whose
Website section tells you to run them; don't run them otherwise. Server logs live
in `.run/`.

## Making it dynamic

The site is static today, but adding backend behavior is one file away — no second
process, no extra port, all served on the same port 3000:

- **Server function** — call server-only code (DB, secrets, fetch) directly from a
  component:

  ```tsx
  import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

  const getMessage = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
    return { message: "Hello from the server" };
  });
  ```

- **API route** — add `src/routes/api/<name>.ts` for a REST endpoint.

## Adding a database

When the site needs to store data (form submissions, content, accounts), connect a
database rather than writing to files:

1. Call `discover_tools` for a database (e.g. "serverless Postgres with a free
   tier"). The owner connects it (Neon) from the card, which provides `DATABASE_URL`.
2. Query it from server-only code with the built-in helper — never from the client:

   ```tsx
   import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";
   import { sql } from "~/db";

   const getPosts = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
     const rows = await sql()`select id, title, created_at from posts`;
     // Coerce non-primitive columns before returning — timestamps come back as JS
     // Dates, which React will not render:
     return rows.map((r) => ({ ...r, created_at: String(r.created_at) }));
   });
   ```

`DATABASE_URL` is injected into this sandbox automatically once connected, and it's
passed to the live host by `bun run go-live` — so the same code works in the preview
and in production. If you connect the database _after_ going live, re-run
`bun run go-live` so production picks up `DATABASE_URL`. One database serves both the
preview and the live site.
