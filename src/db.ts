/**
 * Server-only handle to the team's database (Neon serverless Postgres over HTTP).
 * The connection string comes from `DATABASE_URL`, which the owner connects via
 * the database card and which is injected into the sandbox and passed to the live
 * host on publish. Resolved lazily (per call, not at module load) so the site
 * still builds and serves before a database is connected — the error only
 * surfaces if a query actually runs without `DATABASE_URL`.
 *
 * Use it only inside a `createServerFn()` handler or an `src/routes/api/*` route
 * (never client code):
 *
 *   const getPosts = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
 *     const rows = await sql()`select id, title, created_at from posts`;
 *     // Coerce non-primitive columns (timestamps are JS Dates) to strings before
 *     // returning to the client, or React will refuse to render them:
 *     return rows.map((r) => ({ ...r, created_at: String(r.created_at) }));
 *   });
